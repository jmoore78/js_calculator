DATA TYPE CONVERSION ISSUES
1. EXTRA WORK
-Working with a string as the main data type and then converting to a number creates extra work of converting back and forth later when writing additional functionality. 
    ex. the calculate function using parseFloat then converting the result back to a string so the result can be used in the equation at the user's discretion.

2. INCREASING THE POTENTIAL FOR PROGRAMMER ERRORS
-Using a string as a representation of a number can increase the possibility of mixing up data type methods when converting back and forth
-Adding new functionality and forgetting when something went to conversion and if it's necessary in order to implement that new addition
