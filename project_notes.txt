Project Plan: 
    Create a calculator modeled after the iPhone calculator
    Use Separation of Concerns to prevent/reduce variable pollution and reduce debugging time

Minimum Viable Product:
    Model appearance after the iPhone default calculator COMPLETE
    Needs to process a basic arithmetic equation: add, subtract, multiply, divide COMPLETE
    Ability to clear the values for a new calculation without variable pollution from the previous calculation COMPLETE
    Use addEventListener() for the ability to target multiple elements COMPLETE

Product Backlog:
    Ability to change the current display value from positive to negative or reversal COMPLETE
    Ability to use the pos/neg conversion value in the calculation COMPLETE
    Ability to use the final value of a calculation as the first number in the next equation, without retyping the value COMPLETE
    Percentage conversion COMPLETE
    Ability to preserve the operator value and num2 value while using Equals button to continue calculations (final value calculated against static num2 and static operator values) COMPLETE
    Ability to toggle pos/neg value on final result for next calculation COMPLETE
    Automatically convert long display values to exponential notation OPEN
