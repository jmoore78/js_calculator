Project Plan: 
    Create a calculator modeled after the iPhone calculator
    Use Separation of Concerns to prevent/reduce variable pollution and reduce debugging time

Minimum Viable Product:
    Model appearance after the iPhone default calculator COMPLETE
    Needs to process a basic arithmetic equation: add, subtract, multiply, divide COMPLETE
    Ability to clear the values for a new calculation without variable pollution from the previous calculation COMPLETE
    Use addEventListener() for the ability to target multiple elements COMPLETE

Product Backlog:
    Ability to change the current display value from positive to negative or reversal COMPLETE
    Ability to use the pos/neg conversion value in the calculation COMPLETE
    Ability to use the final value of a calculation as the first number in the next equation, without retyping the value (this includes userchosen positive/negative values) COMPLETE
    Percentage conversion COMPLETE
    Automatically convert long display values to exponential notation OPEN
